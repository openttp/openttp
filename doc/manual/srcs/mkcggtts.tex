\subsection{mkcggtts.py}

\hypertarget{h:mkcggtts}{}

\cc{mkcggtts.py} is used to generate CGGTTS files from RINEX navigation and observation files using
a third part tool. Currently, the only tool supported is \cc{r2cggtts}.

\subsubsection{usage}

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
mkcggtts.py [OPTION] $\ldots$ mjd [mjd $\ldots$]
\end{lstlisting}
The command line options are:
\begin{description*}
	\item[-{}-help,-h]	print the help information and exit
	\item[-{}-debug,-d]	print debugging information to stderr
	\item[-{}-leapsecs \textless{n}\textgreater]	set the number of leap seconds
	\item[-{}-previousmjd]	when no MJD (or one MJD) is given, MJD-1 is added to the MJDs to be processed
	\item[-{}-version,-v] show the version information and exit
\end{description*}

The leap second count in \cc{paramCGGTTS} is determined from the RINEX navigation file if possible.
Otherwise, it can be specified manually via  the \cc{--leapsecs} option.

The \cc{--previousMJD} option is intended to be used in automated daily processing using \cc{r2cggtts}, 
to reprocess data for any missed track at the end of the day.
