This chapter gives a short introduction to the Open Traceable Time Platform (OpenTTP), describing the Reference Platform and other supported hardware.

\section{What is OpenTTP?}

The Open Traceable Time Platform is an open-source solution for a timing system that can be made fully traceable to national standards.
It achieves traceability using the GPS common-view technique, which allows distant clocks to be compared with an accuracy of a few ns.
The reference platform is based on readily available, low-cost OEM modules and provides a full software and hardware solution. 

The goals of the OpenTTP project are:
\begin{enumerate}

	\item Fully open source hardware and software 
		\footnote{The Reference Platform uses some black-box software modules supplied by the FPGA vendor which cannot be freely distributed.}
	
	\item Easy customisation for specialised applications
	
	\item Production of time-transfer files in the standard CGGTTS data format 
		(currently for GPS only)
	
	\item Easy extension to new receivers

	\item Low cost
	
	\item Provision of a convenient framework for research and development.

\end{enumerate}

Applications currently include provision of traceable time of day and auditing of NTP-synchronized systems.

\section{The OpenTTP software suite}

The OpenTTP software suite provides a full solution for automated logging and processing of time-transfer data.
It is available via GitHub:
\begin{lstlisting}
https://github.com/openttp
\end{lstlisting}
Users are invited to contribute to its development.

The software supports a number of GNSS receivers and counters. 
The supported GNSS receivers are mostly low-cost, single-frequency receivers
since low cost is a key objective of the OpenTTP project. 
Low-cost dual frequency receivers have recently become available and one of these,
the ublox ZED-F9, is now supported by OpenTTP.

	
\subsection{Supported GNSS receivers}

OpenTTP currently supports the receivers listed in table \ref{t:receivers}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Manufacturer & models & notes \\ \hline
Javad & GRIL receivers & obsolete \\
NVS   & NV08 & \\
Septentrio & PolaRx family& \\
Trimble & Resolution T & obsolete\\
ublox & NEO-M8T,ZED-F9P,ZED-F9T & may work with earlier receivers\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Supported GPS/GNSS receivers.\label{t:receivers}}
\end{table}

OpenTTP uses a custom file format for logging GPS receiver data. 
It does not read native receiver binary-format files.

Guidance on testing a receiver for suitability for time-transfer, and writing software to process
the receiver's data, is given in the OpenTTP Developer's Guide.

\subsection{Supported counters}

Counters supported by OpenTTP are listed in \ref{t:counters}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Manufacturer & models & notes \\ \hline
Agilent & 5313x &  needs IOTech GPIB to RS232 converter\\
Keysight & 53230A & uses USB TMC\\
OpenTTP & XEM6001 & simple FPGA-based counter/timer \\
Pendulum & CNT-9x &  \\
SRS & PRS10 & uses the input 1 pps time-tagging function\\
TAPR & TICC &\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Supported counters. \label{t:counters}}
\end{table}

The file format used \ref{s:TICformat} is very simple and it should be easy to convert from another format, if needed.
	
\section{The OpenTTP reference platform}

The OpenTTP reference platform currently consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Raspberry Pi4, an ARM-based single board computer
\item ublox ZED-F9T GNSS receiver
\item Opal Kelly XEM6001 FPGA development board
\item Jackson Labs LTE Lite GPS-disciplined oscillator
\item Solid-state disk for mass storage
\item CrystalFontz LCD module
\end{itemize}

The prototype version used the BeagleBone Black single board computer and NVS NV08 receiver.
Custom circuits, printed circuit board designs and other hardware resources are all available via the GitHub repository.

\subsection{Licenses}

The software is available under the MIT license.
